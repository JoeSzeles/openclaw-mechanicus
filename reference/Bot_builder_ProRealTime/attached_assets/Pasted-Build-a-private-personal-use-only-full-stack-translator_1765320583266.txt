Build a private, personal-use-only full-stack translator app on Replit that I will only run by clicking "Run" (never deploy, no public URL).

Tech stack:
- Frontend: Vite (Vanilla JS + HTML) with instant hot reload
- Backend: Node.js + Express in the same Repl
- Styling: Tailwind CSS via Vite plugin
- Persistence: Use Replit Database (key-value) + Replit file storage (for large texts/PDFs)

Layout (single-page, responsive):
- Left sidebar (collapsible on mobile): "Translation History"
  → List of all past translations with date, book title (or first 30 chars), and delete button
  → Clicking an entry instantly loads that book’s original text, custom prompt, translated text, and re-generates PDFs on demand
- Main area:
  1. Input section:
     • Big textarea OR drag-and-drop for .txt / .pdf / .md
     • Optional: Book Title, Author
     • "Custom Instructions" textarea (same examples as before)
     • Big "Translate & Generate PDF(s)" button
  2. After translation:
     • Full translated text shown in a scrollable, copyable area (raw AI response)
     • Detected chapters preview + radio: [One PDF] or [One per chapter → ZIP]
     • Progress bar + live status
     • Generate & download PDFs (pdfmake + Noto Serif, professional book layout)
  3. Dark mode toggle at top

Translation:
- Use ONLY Replit-managed AI models (prefer Claude 3.5 Sonnet → GPT-4o-mini fallback)
- System prompt: "You are an expert literary translator."
- Full prompt = system + user’s Custom Instructions + "Translate to beautiful, natural English (or as specified):" + chunk
- Smart chunking with overlap

History & Storage (automatic, no extra clicks):
- On every successful translation:
  → Save to Replit Database:
    key = timestamp + random ID
    value = { date, title, author, customPrompt, originalText, translatedText, chapters[] }
  → Save generated PDF(s) or ZIP to Replit file storage (/downloads/uuid/)
  → Sidebar instantly updates with new entry
- Clicking a history item loads everything back (text, prompt, translated result) and lets me re-download PDFs

Extra polish:
- "Copy translated text" button
- "Delete" button per history item
- Auto-scroll sidebar to newest entry
- Mobile-friendly (sidebar collapses to hamburger menu)

Rules:
- NEVER ask for API keys — use only Replit-managed models
- Use Replit Database and file storage (already available on Pro)
- This Repl stays 100% private forever
- Vite hot reload must work perfectly

When finished, just say “Done — click Run and open the Vite preview”.
