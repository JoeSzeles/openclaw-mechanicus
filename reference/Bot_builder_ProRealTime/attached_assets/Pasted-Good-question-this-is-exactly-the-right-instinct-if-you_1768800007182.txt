Good question — this is exactly the right instinct if you want **repeatable, grounded bot generation** instead of hallucinated strategies.

Here’s how to **address ProRealCode / ProRealTime forum sources explicitly in future prompts**, in a way that actually *changes the model’s behavior*.

---

## 1️⃣ Use a **Source Anchor** in your prompt (most important)

Always name the source **as a constraint**, not as inspiration.

**Template (recommended):**

```
Source constraint:
- Use ONLY conventions, syntax, and idioms commonly found in public ProRealCode (prorealcode.com) forum posts for ProRealTime / ProOrder bots.
- Assume IG Markets + ProRealTime AutoTrading environment.
- Do NOT invent undocumented functions or syntax.
```

This tells the model:

* stay inside *real* ProRealTime language
* avoid fantasy indicators / PineScript bleed
* behave like a ProRealCode forum contributor

---

## 2️⃣ Reference the **community style**, not just the site

ProRealCode bots have a recognizable “accent”:

* verbose IF / ENDIF blocks
* simple variables
* defensive `ONMARKET` checks
* `DEFPARAM` at the top
* minimal abstraction

You can lock that in explicitly:

```
Style constraint:
- Write code in the style of ProRealCode forum users:
  - flat structure
  - explicit conditions
  - readable variable names
  - no compact one-liners
```

This prevents the model from producing “clever but invalid” code.

---

## 3️⃣ Add a **negative constraint** (this matters)

Tell it what *not* to do, based on ProRealTime reality:

```
Exclusions:
- No PineScript
- No MQL4/5
- No TradingView-only functions
- No arrays unless strictly necessary
- No undocumented ProRealTime keywords
```

This mirrors how experienced ProRealCode users think.

---

## 4️⃣ Lock the **execution environment**

You’ve been working with **IG + ProRealTime**, so bake that in:

```
Execution environment:
- Broker: IG Markets
- Platform: ProRealTime AutoTrading (ProOrder)
- Instrument: CFD (supports PERPOINT sizing)
- Timeframes: intraday (5m–15m typical)
```

This avoids bots that “work” in theory but fail in IG’s ruleset.

---

## 5️⃣ Example of a **perfect future prompt**

You can literally reuse this:

```
Act as an experienced ProRealCode forum contributor.

Source constraint:
- Follow conventions and syntax used in public ProRealCode (prorealcode.com) strategy posts.
- Target ProRealTime ProOrder for IG Markets.

Style:
- Clear variable block at the top
- Defensive ONMARKET logic
- Simple, readable IF / ENDIF structure
- No exotic indicators

Task:
Create a configurable intraday breakout bot with:
- Adjustable lookback
- Time filter
- Fixed % stop and target
- Designed to be stable on 5m charts

Also:
- Comment the code like a forum post explaining logic
```

That prompt will give you **forum-grade bots**, not generic AI junk.

---

## 6️⃣ Optional: create a **short name for the source**

If you want shorthand for long conversations, define it once:

```
Definition:
"PRC-style" = ProRealCode forum-compatible ProRealTime bot code
```

Then later you can just say:

> “Write this in PRC-style.”

---

### If you want next steps

I can:

* define a **PRC-style bot template** you reuse forever
* build a **“safe skeleton”** that almost never breaks on IG
* translate messy forum bots into **clean, parametric versions**

Just tell me which one.
