Here’s a clear, detailed and ready-to-copy app description that you can directly paste into Replit Agent (or any developer/coder) so they can build exactly what you want — 100% free AI translation, JavaScript/Node.js based, works perfectly on Replit.

### App Name (suggested)
**Free AI Book Translator → English PDF**

### One-sentence summary
A public web app on Replit (Node.js) that lets users paste text or upload TXT / PDF / MD files containing one or multiple stories in any language, translates everything to natural English using free AI models, and outputs either one beautiful PDF or multiple PDFs (one per story/chapter), ready to download.

### Core Requirements (must-have)

1. Tech stack (must run on Replit without paid plans)
   - Node.js + Express
   - Pure HTML/CSS/JS frontend (no React needed, keep it simple and fast)
   - Everything must use only free-tier or self-hosted services

2. Input methods (user can choose one)
   - Paste plain text directly into a big textarea
   - Upload file: .txt, .pdf, .md (single or multiple files via drag-and-drop or button)

3. Free translation (zero cost, no API keys required)
   Use one or a combination (in order of preference):
   - LibreTranslate public/free instances (https://libretranslate.com or https://libretranslate.de)
   - Argos Translate via public API
   - Hugging Face Inference API (free tier) with NLLB-200, M2M100, or Helsinki-NLP models
   - Fallback: google-translate-api-x (unofficial, unlimited, works in 2025)

   → The app must auto-detect source language and translate to English (US).

4. Smart story/chapter detection
   - Automatically detect if the text contains one story or multiple stories/chapters
   - Detection rules (in priority order):
     - Split on headings that look like “Chapter 1”, “Chapter One”, “CHAPTER 2”, “Part I”, etc.
     - Split on lines like “===”, “***”, “— — —” (common story separators)
     - Split on very large gaps (multiple empty lines)
     - If no clear separators → treat as single story
   - Show user a preview: “We detected X stories/chapters. Generate one PDF or one per story?”

5. Output options (user chooses)
   - One single PDF containing everything
   - Multiple PDFs (one file per detected story/chapter, downloadable as ZIP or individually)

6. Beautiful PDF generation (must look like a real book)
   - Use pure JavaScript: PDF-lib or pdfmake (both work perfectly on Replit, no native dependencies)
   - Nice typography: proper fonts (include Noto Serif or Liberation Serif via Google Fonts or base64)
   - Justified text, page numbers, optional title page, headings styled correctly
   - A5 or Letter size, good margins

7. Download
   - Immediate download button(s)
   - If multiple PDFs → auto-zip them and offer “Download all as ZIP”

8. Nice, mobile-friendly UI
   - Clean, modern look (Tailwind CSS or plain CSS)
   - Progress bar while translating and generating
   - Success message with download buttons

### Bonus (nice to have, if easy)
- Option to enter book title and author (added to title page)
- Remember last used settings
- Dark mode toggle
- “Copy translated text only” button

### Non-requirements
- No user accounts
- No payment, no API keys from the user
- No OpenAI, DeepL, Google Cloud, or any paid API

### Example user flow
1. User lands on page → sees paste box + upload button
2. Pastes or uploads a Spanish short-story collection (.txt)
3. App detects 8 stories → shows preview
4. User clicks “One PDF per story”
5. App translates with free NLLB/HuggingFace or LibreTranslate → generates 8 PDFs → zips them → downloads automatically
6. Done in under 2–5 minutes even for a 100-page book

### Final instruction to Replit Agent / developer
“Build this exactly as described using only free tools. Prioritize LibreTranslate + pdfmake or PDF-lib. The entire app must run forever on a free Replit account with no API keys needed from users. Make the PDFs look professional and book-like.”
