Perfect — then we **hard-restrict to zero-API-key sources only** 👍
Below is a **clean, practical setup** that works *today* and fits your **Auto-Trading + AI learning tab** without signups, keys, or accounts.

---

## ✅ NO-API-KEY Silver & Gold Data (Usable)

### **1️⃣ Yahoo Finance (Primary Source) — BEST OPTION**

**Unofficial, but reliable and widely used**

**Silver**

```
XAGUSD=X
```

**Gold**

```
XAUUSD=X
```

**Endpoint pattern**

```
https://query1.finance.yahoo.com/v8/finance/chart/XAGUSD=X
```

**What you get**

* ✅ Live / near-live price
* ✅ OHLC bars
* ✅ Multiple timeframes (1m → 1d)
* ✅ Long historical depth
* ❌ No order book (not needed)

**Why this fits your app perfectly**

* Polling-friendly
* Easy JSON
* Stable enough for AI + backtests
* Used by TradingView scrapers, quants, bots

👉 **This should be your main feed**

---

### **2️⃣ Stooq (Backup / Historical)**

Simple CSV downloads.

```
https://stooq.com/q/d/l/?s=xagusd&i=d
https://stooq.com/q/d/l/?s=xauusd&i=d
```

**What you get**

* ✅ Daily OHLC history
* ✅ No limits
* ❌ No intraday

**Use case**

* Backfill data
* Model training
* Regime analysis

---

### **3️⃣ Investing.com (Scrape-only fallback)**

Not recommended as primary, but usable.

**Pros**

* Free
* Near-real-time

**Cons**

* HTML scraping
* Breaks often
* Legal gray area

👉 Only use if Yahoo is temporarily down.

---

## ❌ What You Are *NOT* Using (by choice)

You explicitly avoid these:

* ❌ Alpha Vantage
* ❌ Quandl / Nasdaq
* ❌ Metals APIs
* ❌ Broker feeds
* ❌ CME / LBMA

Good call — this keeps the system **open + offline-trainable**.

## 🧠 Data Coverage vs Your Auto-Trading Tab

| Requirement           | Yahoo | Stooq |
| --------------------- | ----- | ----- |
| Live price            | ✅     | ❌     |
| OHLC bars             | ✅     | ✅     |
| Multi-timeframe       | ✅     | ❌     |
| Backtesting           | ✅     | ✅     |
| AI probability curves | ✅     | ✅     |
| No API key            | ✅     | ✅     |

## 🧩 Recommended Architecture (No API Keys)

```
[ Yahoo Finance Poller ]
        |
        v
[ Bar Normalizer ]
 (M1 → M5 → H1 → D1)
        |
        v
[ Feature Engine ]
 (RSI, MACD, ATR, VWAP)
        |
        v
[ AI / Probability Engine ]
 (targets + % chance)
        |
        v
[ ProRealTime Code Generator ]
```

---

## 🔒 Stability & Safety Notes (Important)

Because Yahoo is unofficial:

* Cache aggressively
* Retry with backoff
* Never trade tick-by-tick
* Use **bar-close logic only** (PRT-style)

This actually aligns *perfectly* with ProRealTime’s philosophy.

---

## ✅ Final Recommendation (Do This)

**Use only:**

* Yahoo Finance → live + intraday
* Stooq → historical backfill

No keys. No signups. No dependency hell.

---

If you want next:

* I can write a **Node.js Yahoo poller** (clean + safe)
* Add **anti-ban throttling**
* Build **multi-timeframe aggregation**
* Wire it directly into your AI learning tab

Just say the word 👌
